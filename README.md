# Omni_chassis

the mechanical design and control system of a material conveying mobile robot. The robot uses a three-wheel driven chassis and has omni-directional mobility. The mechanical system based on three omni wheels that help in changing the direction of the robot by varying direction and velocity of each wheel individually, without even altering the orientation.

# Acknowledgement
we would like to express our grattitude to our mentros Aman Singh (mech 4th year) and Prashant Kumar (mech 4th year) as well as our guide and senior mentor aayushi shrivastava (EE 4th year & secretary, Models and Robotics Section) who gave us the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project which helped us in doing a lot of research and we came to know about so many new things. 

# Pre-Requisites:
  * omni wheels
  * Aluminium channels
  * Arduino mega
  * 3 high torque DC motors
  * Jumper wires
  * motor driver 
  * encoders
  * battery
  
# Work:
Each wheel is placed in such orientation that its axis of rotation points towards the centre of the robot and there is an angle of 120ยบ between the wheels and aligned like in an equilateral triangle so that their axis intersect at the robot centre. In the centre it can be seen the specially built encoders coupled to each motor axis.This type of wheels has small rollers to allow the wheels to move freely on any direction. They move along the primary diameter, just as any other wheel. Though, the smaller rollers along the outside of this diameter allow free rotation along an orthogonal direction to the powered rotation. For this type of configuration, the total platform displacement is achieved by summing up all the three vectors contributions.
  
# Future Improvements:
1. better accuracy would be brought in angles while manufacturing.
